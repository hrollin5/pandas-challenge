# Pandas-Challenge
This project shows the capabilities of Pandas for data analysis. The data are combined into a single data frame, manipulated, sorted, binned, and displayed in clean, easy-to-read formats. Included are the CSV files of data and a Jupyter notebook with my code and analysis. 

## PyCitySchools
Analyze the district-wide standardized test results. Provided are every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Data is aggregated to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Findings are reported at the top of the notebook and the following tables are included:
  * A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics
  * A summary of key metrics for each school
  * Schools sorted by highest and lowest performance
  * Average math and reading scores per school aggregated by grade 
  * Scores grouped by school spending
  * Scores grouped by school size
  * Scores grouped by school type (charter or district)
