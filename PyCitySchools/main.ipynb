    "- The school district displays significant variation in performance, with the highest performing school achieving an impressive overall pass rate of 91% among students, while the lowest performing school records a much lower pass rate of only 53%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Charter schools, which are independent publicly funded schools, outperform district schools in terms of student performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The difference in performance between charter schools and district schools appears to be associated with the size of the schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Smaller schools consistently exhibit considerably better performance outcomes compared to larger schools within the district.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contrary to common expectations, an increase in spending per student does not appear to have a positive impact on academic performance. In fact, there may be a correlation suggesting that increased spending per student is linked to decreased test scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Further analysis is necessary to determine the significance of this negative correlation and whether it truly indicates a causal relationship between spending and academic performance.\n",
